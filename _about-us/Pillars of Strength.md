<p style="text-align: center;">SMC Chairman (1976 0 1994)</p>
<p>A loyal and faithful friend and trusted advisor to the Good Shepherd Sisters from 1940 until his death on 24 August 1994, Dr Ee was Chairman of the School Board of Management for 30 years.</p>
<p>During his years of service, he was loved by all who worked with him. He worked tirelessly and with joyful dedication for the establishment of Marymount Convent School. His years of dedicated service and support have made Marymount Convent School what it is today.</p>
<p>Besides seeing to our financial needs, he is fondly remembered as a chairman who always showed physical and moral support for all our important school functions. He was always prompt in responding to the many needs of the school. A firm believer in the importance of a good education, a father and friends to teenagers in need, he gave generously. A quiet, unassuming yet dynamic man, he truly understood and lived the teachings of Christ. Since his demise, his children, Ms Cecilia Ee and Mr Gerard Ee, have been actively contributing to the growth of the school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;whatever you did to the least of my brethren, you did to me&rdquo; (Mt.24:30). He will always be remembered with gratitude and affection as the co-founder of Marymount Convent School.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ms Cecilia Ee, daughter of the late Dr Ee Peng Liang, has been a continuous support to the school and the Good Shepherd Mission. She is a former pupil of Marymount Convent School and in 1999 to 2001, she was the school supervisor. She has always been an active member in the school management committee and in the school alumnae. MCS is truly blessed and proud to call Ms Cecilia Ee our stalwart Daughter of Marymount.&nbsp;</p>
