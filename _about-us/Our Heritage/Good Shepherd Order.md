<h4><strong>Good Shepherd Order (Singapore)&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p><strong>First GS Nuns in Singapore</strong>
</p>
<p>The Good Shepherd Sisters arrived in Singapore on 12th December 1939.
These Irish nuns were Mother Liguori Bourke and Sr Alphonsus Moody who
were the first pioneers. Sr Columba Cannon and Sr Dympna Brady arrived
shortly after in January 1940.</p>
<p>The Good Shepherd Sisters opened their doors to women and girls who were
troubled or abused and in need of healing and reconciliation.</p>
<p>Their first girl, Mary, was received in the home on 6th February 1940.
By May 1940, the home had 11 residents. It was a significant year for the
Sisters as their Foundress, Sr Mary Euphrasia Pelletier, was canonized
St Mary Euphrasia on 2nd May 1940.</p>

<p>The Good Shepherd (GS) Sisters responded to a request from the Singapore
government to help care for troubled girls in Singapore. Two Irish GS Sisters,
Mother Liguori Burke &amp; Sr Alphonsus Moody, arrived in December and
founded the 352nd&nbsp;house of the GS Congregation in Singapore. They
were joined later by Sr Dympna from Macao and Sr Columba Cannon from Sri
Lanka in Jan 1940.</p>

<p>The GS Sisters quickly set up a convent in a rented bungalow in Punggol
and soon, the small bungalow was overcrowded. The GS Sisters finally managed
to buy a bigger house in MacPherson Road to house the nuns and girls.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Unfortunately the house in MacPherson Road did not last long. It was blown
up during the war by the British forces who had secretly stored ammunition
there. Faced without choice, the inhabitants, 5 Sisters and 27 children,
were forced to move to other quarters. First, they went to the Convent
of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) in Paya Lebar. Next, they moved to the
CHIJ in Victoria Street with 500 other refugees. Then, after taking 7 direct
hits from the bombing and shelling, the sisters and 30 girls sought refuge
in Po Leung Kuk before moving yet again to Sr Teresa’s Bungalow. When the
Japanese occupied Singapore, they were sent to a camp in Malaysia where
somehow, they managed to put with up the miserable living conditions and
survive the many diseases.</p>

<p>When the war finally ended, the sisters and the children returned to Singapore.
With help from various sources, a convent cum vocational centre for homeless
girls was set up at Kampong Java Road.</p>
<p>Repeated requests came from the Education Department for the sisters to
set up a school, resulting in the opening of a kindergarten at Kampong
Java in 1947. Soon, requests came from parents for the sisters to set up
a primary and secondary school for their daughters who had missed out on
formal education during the Japanese Occupation. The English school at
Kampong Java Convent (Primary) called Good Shepherd Convent was opened
in 1947.</p>
