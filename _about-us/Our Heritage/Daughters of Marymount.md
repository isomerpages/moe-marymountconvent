<p><strong>Love people, love them very much. Console and strengthen them. By God&rsquo;s grace, make them happy, very happy.</strong></p>
<p>MCS Then and Now</p>
<p>Then: At Marymount, the pioneer nuns operated a home for orphans who were mainly post-war children. As there was a need for education, Marymount Convent School was set up. Many of these initial pupilswere from underprivileged backgrounds and they could not afford to pay for an education. The nuns were their main teachers imparting an academic and values education. The emphasis was on training the pupils to be ladies of eloquence. The nuns believed in upholding the dignity of each person, nurturing the potential within each person and promoting a culture of life, peace and growth. The holistic development of the pupils encompassed the cultural, social, spiritual, physical and intellectual aspects of education. As there was a secondary school then, the older girls were responsible for a wide variety of activities like the planning of carnivals and outdoor art competitions. MOE teachers were also employed to teach in the school.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&ldquo;If you wish to gain hearts, you must first win them over and take care of them, showing them much care and consideration&ldquo;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Now: The school supervisor, Sr Delphine, is still involved in the religious and values education of the pupilss. There are also mid-morning prayers for the pupils to afford opportunities for reflection. The pupils that MCS attracts now come from a wider background, including international pupils from India, China, Malaysia and Korea. The initial purpose of setting up the school is still relevant as it still caters to pupils from AHUVA and other deserving cases. The emphasis on eloquence is till prevalent. Since the closure of the secondary school, activities are now focused on the primary section.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&ldquo;Do everything as far as you can for love and you will see what you are capable of! One can make more progress this way in a year, than in ten by the way of fear."</strong></p>
