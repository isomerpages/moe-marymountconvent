Rainbows have always been one of my favourites. Their splendor, quiet steadfastness and their full expanse across the skies fascinate me. Rainbows, while they may be an optical phenomena in Science, always remind me of the love and steadfastness of God, and the beauty of His creations. They bring me God’s Promises of grace and mercy; and I am confident that God will always light up the rainbows for me to ride on them.

It is with this same confidence that I step into Marymount Convent School – that God will be my Light as I serve in my capacity as Principal. Indeed, I am grateful for the opportunity to serve in a school anchored in the fundamental Christian ethos that every child is precious in the eyes of God, and should be well-loved.  That is also why that ‘one person is of more value than the whole world’, the belief advocated by St Mary Euphrasia, resonates deeply with me. Every child, each and every one of them, is important.

As an educator, I believe that whatever we do must serve the needs of each and every child - not _all_, not _some_, but _each and every child_.  Not ‘all’ because that would mean that our programmes, overly general or generic, may seem to cater to all but miss the individual; and why not ‘some’, the answer is obvious.  To me, it must always be ‘each and every child’ for that would mean that we notice each and every one of them. We will then centre on the child in the _what_ and _how_ we do things in the school to bring out the best in them; and importantly, prepare them to be future ready because the world that awaits them is truly an unknown.

To all parents, I look forward to your continued close partnership with us to support the learning and growth of your daughters - grow up to be refined, cultured, strong in body, mind and soul; and be well-placed for secondary schools and most of all, be well-placed for life.

To every girl in MCS, my encouragement to you is this:

There is a glorious rainbow that beckons those with the spirit of adventure. And there are rich findings at the end of that rainbow…look at the horizon, find that rainbow, **go ride It**.                                                         

_L.K.Y_

Have a blessed year ahead!
