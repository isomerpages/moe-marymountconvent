<p><strong>Sawubona</strong>
<br>I see you.
<br>I notice you.
<br>I hear you.
<br>All of you.
<br>Your dignity. Your value, and your worth.</p>
<p>It was night, and the winds were strong. You were struggling on your motorcycle
along Bartley Viaduct, trying to balance something heavy behind you, and
you kept looking back. I kept a safe distance from you, deliberately following
you so that no other cars would go behind you. After a while, you began
to ride without turning back, seeming more reassured; and sometime later,
you exited towards Bedok.</p>
<p>You stood outside the Hindu temple along Serangoon Road. You looked frail
in your weather-beaten frame. You struggled to stand steady and were shivering;
yet you held out your hands – or were you holding something? I could not
see clearly, but obviously, you were begging the devotees for a little
money. I struggled within. It was very heavy traffic. I could not stop.
I still think of you from time to time, wondering how you are.</p>
<p>Seated in a coffee joint with full glass panels, I looked out at the rain
outside. I love the rain! Then I saw you. You struggled to get off your
motorcycle in your raincoat. You looked old. You walked gingerly towards
the coffee joint. The moment you entered and walked towards the counter,
I saw how you were treated with disrespect, and maybe even disdain, by
the barista. You were slightly drenched and probably feeling cold, but
you were still doing your food delivery job – collecting the hot coffee
and food, which you probably needed more than anyone else, but which were
for someone who had ordered.</p>
<p>I walked up to you and said, “Uncle, ride carefully; it’s wet outside.”
You were surprised. But you smiled.</p>
<p>Later, I wrote a long email to the management of the coffee joint, detailing
all my observations of that day. I received an offer of a free cuppa. I
don’t need it. Do better next time.</p>
<p>You sat on the floor at the school foyer, with your palms on your cheeks.
I walked over. “Are you okay?” I asked. You said, “No.” I sat on the floor
with you. You shared how tired you were from school and what had happened.
I invited you to reframe and encouraged you to keep going. Your mum drove
into the school. You got in, still looking tired. I feel you. It was a
long day for you.</p>
<p>You sat alone, eating at recess. I asked you, “Why aren’t you sitting
with your friends?” You shrugged your shoulders. You seemed to want to
be alone. I left you. I texted your teacher about it.</p>
<p>With the weight of the laptop and everything else in your hands and bag,
from afar, I could see that you looked a little drained. I texted, “Are
you okay? You seem tired. Hope you get some rest. Teaching is a tiring
job; I know.”</p>
<p>I see you. I see your pain, but most of all, I see your dignity, your
value, and your worth. Everyone has the same worth as everybody else. We
are equal, made in the image of God – big or small, young or old, rich
or poor.</p>
<p>Am I better than everyone else with what I have shared above? No. Categorically,
“No,” I say to you. It’s only this: I see you.</p>
<p>This new year, 2026, I wish for all of us – teachers, non-teaching staff,
and all our close to 1,300 girls. I wish that you will also say, “I see
you.” Learn to notice one another – their joy, their pain, their tiredness,
their dignity, value, and worth. Learn to feel the emotions of another
person; and move beyond understanding and feeling – do something for the
person(s): support, assistance, a listening ear. Be life-giving.</p>
<p>Where did I learn this? From a simple Zulu, South African greeting—<em>Sawubona</em>.
They don’t just say hi or hello. They say&nbsp;<em>Sawubona</em>, which
means:&nbsp;<em>I see you.</em>
</p>
<p>By truly seeing one another and doing something good for them, we recognise
the image of God within them.</p>
<p>Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers
and sisters of mine, you did for me.</p>
<p>Matthew 25:40</p>
<p>Have a blessed year ahead!</p>
