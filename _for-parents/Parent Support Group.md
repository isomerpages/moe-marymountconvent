<h4><strong>Welcome!</strong></h4>
<p>Welcome to Marymount Convent School&rsquo;s Parent Support Group (PSG) Page! I am most glad to share with you about who we are and the activities that we are involved in. As a group of enthusiastic parents, we can actively contribute and share in our daughter&rsquo;s school life.</p>
<p><strong>About us</strong></p>
<p>Formed in April 2013 after a hiatus of 4 years, we had to build up our foundation again. Our goal at this stage is to channel all parent volunteer activities under the PSG. In the long term, we hope to embark on more ambitious projects to enhance the quality of the school activities and programmes.</p>
<p><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></p>
<p>Our main objective is to support and partner with Marymount Convent School (MCS) in activities that benefit the entire MCS community. We are green with compassion for the school and for the social environment. We are parents from walks of life coming together for this common purpose in cooperation, respect and in unity symbolised by the circle. Fonts are chosen to be curved and round to signify the friendly approach to the things we do. Last but not least, the pair of wings represent the guidance we want to give to the school and to our girls.</p>

<p><strong>PSG Activities</strong></p>
<p>Our members have contributed much of their time and talent to the many activities over the years. From helping out with registration at the P6 workshop to manning game stalls on Racial Harmony Day. We were also playing chapteh, congkak, five stones, gasing and many other traditional games with the girls. There are many other ad-hoc activities throughout the year where our help is needed like to chaperon the girls on excursion trips, CCA performances and the year-end school carnival. We also have regular volunteer programmes such as Catechists for the Catholic Values Education Programme which requires a weekly commitment.</p>
<p>In recent years, we also have new activities like the P1 and P2 Indoor Picnic, as well as Family Bonding Zumba Day and Family Bonding Movie Day. These events aims to strengthen not only the individual families but the whole MCS Big Family!&nbsp;</p>
