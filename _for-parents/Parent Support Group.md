<h4><strong>Welcome!</strong></h4>
<p>Welcome to Marymount Convent School&rsquo;s Parent Support Group (PSG) Page! I am most glad to share with you about who we are and the activities that we are involved in. As a group of enthusiastic parents, we can actively contribute and share in our daughter&rsquo;s school life.</p>
<p><strong>About us</strong></p>
<p>Formed in April 2013 after a hiatus of 4 years, we had to build up our foundation again. Our goal at this stage is to channel all parent volunteer activities under the PSG. In the long term, we hope to embark on more ambitious projects to enhance the quality of the school activities and programmes.</p>
<p><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></p>
<p>Our main objective is to support and partner the school in activities for the benefit of all in the MCS community. Our logo shows the many hands of parents from different races and all walks of life, putting their hands in for this common purpose. We are red with passion and enthusiasm; united, in cooperation and completeness, which is symbolized by the circle. This logo was designed by one of our very own PSG member!&nbsp;</p>
