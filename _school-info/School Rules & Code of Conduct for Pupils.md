<p>In MCS, we believe strongly in the character building of every student. We celebrate their growth and ensure we inculcate strong values in our students. The Code of Conduct therefore serves to show our students the corresponding good behaviour one will demonstrate when they practise good values.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="2"><p><strong>Rule 1 : Be Present and Punctual for all School Activities</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="2"><p><strong>Attendance</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>1.1</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Students must enter the school premises and be seated in the hall/classroom before 7.35 a.m.</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>1.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Students must be on time for CCAs, extra classes and all other activities.</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>1.3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Students must be present for all lessons unless there is a valid reason.</p><p>Students’ absence from lessons must be accompanied by a medical certificate or letter of excuse from parent / guardian and promptly submitted to the Form Teacher(s) on the day the student returns to school.&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>1.4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Students must remain within the school grounds once they have reported to&nbsp;school.
