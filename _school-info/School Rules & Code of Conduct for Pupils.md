<p>Anchored in the beliefs and values of the Good Shepherd, the school is
committed to nurturing a safe, supportive and enabling learning environment
for every student. Students are responsible for making their own school
experience, and that of their schoolmates, a safe, supportive, and joyful
one. Guidance and support are given to students involved to take responsibility
for their choices, learn from the consequences of their actions and live
out the values of love, humility, respect and grace in words and deeds.</p>
<p>In Marymount Convent School, we believe that</p>
<p>• Every student can make good choices.
<br>• Every student is responsible for her choice of actions.
<br>• Every student needs to understand that wrong choices may lead to misbehaviours
which lead to learning consequences.
<br>• Every student has the right to learn without disruptions.
<br>• Every student has the right to feel safe in school.
<br>• Everyone must be respected at all times.</p>
<p>School rules are established so that students can develop self-discipline
and sound decision-making skills which are essential for success in life.
The Code of Conduct serves to guide students in demonstrating behaviours
that reflect the values they practise. &nbsp;</p>
