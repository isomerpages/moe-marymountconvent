---
<p>Anchored in the beliefs and values of the Good Shepherd, the school is
committed to nurturing a safe, supportive and enabling learning environment
for every student. Students are responsible for making their own school
experience, and that of their schoolmates, a safe, supportive, and joyful
one. Guidance and support are given to students involved to take responsibility
for their choices, learn from the consequences of their actions and live
out the values of love, humility, respect and grace in words and deeds.</p>
<p>In Marymount Convent School, we believe that</p>
<p>• Every student can make good choices.
<br>• Every student is responsible for her choice of actions.
<br>• Every student needs to understand that wrong choices may lead to misbehaviours
which lead to learning consequences.
<br>• Every student has the right to learn without disruptions.
<br>• Every student has the right to feel safe in school.
<br>• Everyone must be respected at all times.</p>
<p>School rules are established so that students can develop self-discipline
and sound decision-making skills which are essential for success in life.
The Code of Conduct serves to guide students in demonstrating behaviours
that reflect the values they practise. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The school adopts MOE's Philosophy on Student Management.</p>
<p>• Students learn well when there is order and discipline. At the same
time, they need care, encouragement and space to learn from mistakes and
improve.</p>
<p>• Discipline is an educative process, and the goal is to instil self-discipline
and good character in students.</p>
<p>• Disciplinary measures are the consequences of poor choices made. They
are not punishments and must be meted out fairly, firmly, and appropriately.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our educators adopt a caring, student-focussed approach when addressing
disciplinary matters. All decisions made and actions taken by the school
will focus on:</p>
<p>• how to help students to learn to become a better person;</p>
<p>• the impact of the offence on other students; and</p>
<p>• the well-being of all students.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As such, when incidents occur, students will be asked to share the facts
of the matter, both through conversation and in writing.</p>
<p>The school adopts Restorative Practice (RP) when guiding the student who
has made a poor choice. This is an approach that aims to:</p>
<p>• Manage conflict and tension by repairing harm and strengthening relationships
to build community.</p>
<p>• Foster respectful and trusting relationships as a foundation for teaching
and learning.</p>
<p>• Provide opportunities for students to learn about the consequences of
their actions, develop empathy, and find resolutions.</p>
<p>• Guide students through reflective questions to help them learn from
their mistakes and explore possible solutions.&nbsp;</p>
