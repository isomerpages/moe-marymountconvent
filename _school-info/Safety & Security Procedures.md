<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">5.</span><span style="white-space: pre; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">To facilitate speedy identification of authorized vehicles, all parents / guardians who drive in to drop off and pick up your child are advised to purchase car decals at the General Office.

<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">6.</span><span style="white-space: pre; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Leaving school early</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Students should have valid reasons for leaving school early for instance:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">&bull;</span><span style="white-space: pre; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Falling ill or feeling unwell</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">&bull;</span><span style="white-space: pre; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Sustaining injuries or pain</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">&bull;</span><span style="white-space: pre; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Displaying contagious symptoms of contagious diseases like HFMD, Chicken Pox, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">&bull;</span><span style="white-space: pre; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Submit a doctor&rsquo;s letter to certify that the child is unfit for school</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">In cases when students are needed to be taken home, the school will inform the parent(s) / guardian(s). A student who is ill or has sustained injuries will not be dismissed to go home on her own. Parent(s) or an adult must come to the school to pick the child up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">In cases whereby parents / guardians need to pick the child up to leave school early on any particular day for important matters or good reasons, a letter must be submitted to the Form Teacher at the beginning of that day to facilitate early dismissal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">7.</span><span style="white-space: pre; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Procedures for picking up your child / ward</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">All parents / guardians are to sign in at the Security Guard Post before proceeding to the General Office to indicate your intention to take your child home early.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">It is mandatory for all parents / guardians to complete the &ldquo;Permission to Leave School Premise&rdquo; form before taking your child / ward away. We would like to emphasise that no child should leave the school with parents / guardians without the school&rsquo;s knowledge. We would like everyone&rsquo;s co-operation in adhering to the procedures so as to ensure the safety and security of our students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">8.</span><span style="white-space: pre; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Procedures for contagious illnesses</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Please inform the school upon certification of illness by the doctor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Upon returning to school, the child is to submit a doctor&rsquo;s letter to certify that she is fit for school.</span></p>
