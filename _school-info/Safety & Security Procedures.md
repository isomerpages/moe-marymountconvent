<p>To safeguard the safety and interests of our girls at Marymount Convent
School, please cooperate with the school and adhere to the following procedures
at all times:</p>
<p>1. All visitors entering the school must register at the Security Counter.
Please report there upon arrival.</p>
<p>2. The security guard will check the visitor's identity and verify the
purpose of the visit. A screened visitor will be issued a "Check-in label".
This allows the visitor to proceed directly to the General Office for assistance.
When leaving, the visitor must return the issued "Check-in label"to the
security guard.</p>
<p>3. Parents/visitors are not allowed to proceed to any other parts of the
school or loiter in the school compound.</p>
<p>4. Parents/caregivers driving in are only allowed to do a quick drop-off
or pick­up of their children/wards at the porch.</p>
<p>• There should be no stopping for longer than necessary or parking at
the porch at all times to avoid holding up traffic or taking up space.
<br>• Keep to the approved speed limit of 15 km/h.
<br>• Move all the way to the front/first available alighting bay to alight
your child.
<br>• Do not overtake the vehicles in front of you. Queue in line accordingly
at the alighting points.
<br>• Alight your child only on the left side of the vehicle, not the right.
<br>• Alight your child promptly upon arrival and move off promptly once she
has alighted.</p>
<p>5. For safe and easy vehicular access to the school compound, all vehicles
must clearly display an authorised car label at all times (including arrival
and dismissal hours). Drivers of vehicles without the authorised car label
will be required to provide visitor information to the security guard.
Please note that the car label does not warrant parking in the school.</p>
<p>6. Parent(s)/caregiver(s) who drop off or pick up their children and wish
to cut across the school premises to access the side gate (along Marymount
Road) or back gate (along Toa Payoh Rise) will require a restricted access
pass with photo identification. This includes parent(s)/caregiver(s) who
drop off their children at the foyer via the vehicular main gate and wish
to walk through the school premises to exit via the back gate.</p>
<p>7. Parent(s)/caregiver(s) are not to create noise (e.g., car honking,
talking loudly, etc.) when in school compound.</p>
<p>8. The Smoking Regulations 2018 prohibit smoking in any area within 5
metres of the school compound.</p>
<p>9. The school is committed to partnering with you with sincerity, integrity,
and professionalism. By showing mutual courtesy and respect, we set a positive
example for our children. MOE values our staff and will take firm action
to protect them against any unreasonable behaviour, harassment, or abuse.</p>
<p>THE SCHOOL WILL EXERCISE ITS RIGHTS TO BAN OR RESTRICT ENTRY INTO THE
SCHOOL IF ANYONE IS FOUND TO FLOUT OR DISREGARD ANY OF THE ABOVE PROCEDURES.</p>
<p>10. Students should have valid reasons for leaving school early, such
as:</p>
<p>• Falling ill or feeling unwell.
<br>• Sustaining injuries or pain.
<br>Displaying symptoms of contagious diseases like HFMD, chickenpox, etc.
<br>• Submitting a doctor's letter to certify that the child is unfit for
school. Home emergencies</p>
<p>In cases when students have to be taken home, the school will inform the
parent(s)/caregiver(s). A student who is ill or has sustained injuries
will not be dismissed to go home on her own. A parent(s)/caregiver(s) or
an adult authorised by a parent/caregiver must come to the school to pick
up the child.</p>
<p>If a parent(s)/caregiver(s) needs to pick up the child to leave school
early for important matters or good reasons, please inform the Form Teacher
at the beginning of that day to facilitate early dismissal.</p>
<p>Procedures for picking up your child/ward</p>
<p>All parent(s)/caregiver(s) are to sign in at the Security Counter before
proceeding to the General Office to state your intention to take your child
home early.</p>
<p>It is mandatory for all parents/caregivers to complete the "Permission
to Leave School Premises" form before taking your child/ward away. We would
like to emphasise that no child should leave the school with parents/caregivers
without the General Office's knowledge. Parent(s)/caregiver(s) are to hand
over the "Permission to Leave School Premises" slip and "Check-in label"
to the security guard before leaving the school premises with your child/ward.</p>
<p><strong>Procedures for contagious illnesses </strong>

<p>Please inform the school upon a doctor's certification of illness.
<br>Do not send your child/ward to school if she is suffering from any contagious
illness (e.g., sore eyes, HFMD, Chicken Pox, etc.).
<br>Upon returning to school, your child/ward should submit a doctor's letter
to certify that she is fit for school.</p>
