<p>The Dance Ensemble showcased what went on before getting ready for the big school opening. The dance depicted children in a happy mood as they cleaned and packed to get ready for the big move. Cleaning was not seen as a chore. Instead, the pupils were enthusiastic in their task to make their school a cosy and conducive place to study in. In the midst of their cleaning, pupils showed their lively, cheeky side as they played and teased to the upbeat music.&nbsp;</p></td>

<p>This performance presented by the Modern Dance girls was a representation of the hectic year that they had gone through.
