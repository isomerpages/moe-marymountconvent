<h4><strong>CCA Highlights</strong></h4>
<p><strong>MCS 60<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Anniversary Dinner Performance</strong>
</p>
<p>The Dance Ensemble showcased what went on before getting ready for the
big school opening. The dance depicted children in a happy mood as they
cleaned and packed to get ready for the big move. Cleaning was not seen
as a chore. Instead, the pupils were enthusiastic in their task to make
their school a cosy and conducive place to study in. In the midst of their
cleaning, pupils showed their lively, cheeky side as they played and teased
to the upbeat music.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Prize-giving Performance</strong>
</p>
<p>This performance presented by the Modern Dance girls was a representation
of the hectic year that they had gone through. They took part in the National
Day Parade, which they spent many weekends at the floating platform preparing
for the performance. Even though they had to juggle their time between
dance practice and studies, they enjoyed themselves nevertheless as they
found joy in the midst of busyness.</p>

were in was awarded as one of the Best performances of Chingay in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>National Day Parade</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Dance Ensemble participated in the National Parade in 2018. Through
the experience of performing on the national stage, they have learnt to
project more stage presence and built up their self-confidence. This experience
has also built greater cohesion among the students and their willingness
to help one another.</p>
