<h4><strong>CCA Highlights</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Prize-giving Performance</strong>
</p>
<p>This performance presented by the Modern Dance girls was a representation
of the hectic year that they had gone through. They took part in the National
Day Parade, which they spent many weekends at the floating platform preparing
for the performance. Even though they had to juggle their time between
dance practice and studies, they enjoyed themselves nevertheless as they
found joy in the midst of busyness.</p>
