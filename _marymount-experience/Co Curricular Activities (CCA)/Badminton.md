<p>The Badminton CCA provides students with the opportunity to learn basic
badminton skills such as net drop, lift, clear, smash and footwork. Badminton
is a technical sport that requires a great amount of flexibility, agility,
responsiveness and hand-eye coordination. As part of the gameplay, students
will learn to play in modified matches in singles and doubles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
