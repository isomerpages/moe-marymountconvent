<h4><strong>CCA Information</strong></h4>
<p>The Tennis CCA aims to equip all our students with the necessary skills, knowledge and attitudes that are required of a Tennis player. Students learn basic tennis skills such as forehand, backhand and serve, and also learn to play in modified matches in singles and doubles. Students who are skillful and proficient in the gameplay may be selected to represent the school to participate in the National School Games.</p>
