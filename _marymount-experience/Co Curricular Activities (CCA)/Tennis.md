<h4><strong>CCA Information</strong></h4>

learn basic tennis skills such as forehand, backhand and serve, and also
learn to play in modified matches in singles and doubles. Students who
are skillful and proficient in the gameplay may be selected to represent
the school to participate in the National School Games.</p>
