<h4><strong>CCA Information</strong></h4>
<p>The Tennis CCA aims to equip all our students with the necessary skills,
knowledge and attitudes that are required of a tennis player. Students
learn basic tennis skills such as forehand, backhand and serve, and also
learn to play in modified singles and doubles matches. Students who are
skillful and proficient in the gameplay may be selected to represent the
school to participate in the National School Games.</p>
<p>Through trainings sessions and competitions, the students will develop
good character traits such as sportsmanship.</p>
