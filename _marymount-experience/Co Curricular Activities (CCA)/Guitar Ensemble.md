<h4><strong>CCA Information</strong></h4>
<p>Our Guitar Ensemble is a brand new CCA designed to provide a vibrant platform
for students to experience the joy of collective music-making. These sessions
are perfect for those who find learning an instrument more engaging in
a group setting, allowing members to explore various styles and techniques
together.</p>
<p>Even students with no prior musical background will find it easy and accessible
to pick up guitar skills in our supportive environment. Members will have
the opportunity to specialize in the acoustic guitar, building a strong
foundation in both rhythm and melody.</p>
