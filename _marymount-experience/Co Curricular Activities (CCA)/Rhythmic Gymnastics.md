<h4><strong>CCA Information</strong></h4>
<p>Rhythmic Gymnastics combines multi-disciplinary elements of ballet, dance
and gymnastics. Students use apparatus such as clubs, ropes, hoops and
balls to perform their routines on the floor, accompanied by the tune of
catchy songs or music.</p>

<p>Additionally, they work on exercises that develop or display physical
agility and coordination. For school team athletes, they will progress
to work with handheld apparatus and perform in routines with leaps, contortions
and dance that flow in time to music.</p>

<p>Students in this club are grouped into either School or Recreation Team.
Students in the School Team are expected to train thrice a week. These
students will be selected to represent the school at the annual National
School Games. In addition to that, this CCA also provides several opportunities
for School Team members and selected students from the Recreation Team
to put up performances at school events.</p>

<p>This fun, vibrant CCA not only moulds our girls to be expressive performers
but it also teaches them to be committed, disciplined and resilient.</p>
