<h4><strong>CCA Information</strong></h4>
<p>Percussion Ensemble aims to provide a platform for instrumentalists to come together to experience ensemble music-making. The sessions have been very well-received by members as they find it more interesting to learn the various types of percussion instruments. Members with no prior musical background also found it less challenging to pick up percussion playing skills. Students learn to specialise in an instrument such as drumset, xylophones, glockenspiels, piano and hand chimes. Students may have the opportunity to perform at school events and public at venues such as Esplanade or National Museum, to name a few.

<p>The ensemble also showcases the musical talents of its members through performances at various school functions such as the Arts Festival and Foundress Day &amp; Prize-Giving Ceremony.
Students may have additional CCA sessions on Fridays if they must prepare for public performances. 
	
More information will be shared when the students are invited to perform.</p>
