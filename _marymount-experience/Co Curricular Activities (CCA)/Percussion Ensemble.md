<h4><strong>CCA Information</strong></h4>
<p>Percussion Ensemble aims to provide a platform for instrumentalists to
come together to experience ensemble music-making. The sessions have been
very well-received by members as they find it more interesting to learn
the various types of percussion instruments. Members with no prior musical
background also found it less challenging to pick up percussion playing
skills. Students learn to specialise in an instrument such as drumset,
xylophones, glockenspiels, piano and hand chimes. Students may have the
opportunity to perform at school events and public at venues such as Esplanade
or National Museum, to name a few.</p>

<p>The ensemble also showcases the musical talents of its members through
performances at various school functions such as the Arts Festival and
Foundress Day &amp; Prize-Giving Ceremony. Students may have additional
CCA sessions on Fridays if they must prepare for public performances.</p>
<p>More information will be shared when the students are invited to perform.</p>
