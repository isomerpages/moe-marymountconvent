<h4><strong>CCA Information</strong></h4>
<p>The CCA caters to students who are interested in Netball. Besides learning new skills and playing the game of Netball, the CCA also seeks to foster a spirit of camaraderie, responsibility and discipline among teammates. CCA members also learn important life skills like eating right and journaling their Netball learning experience for future reference.

Netballers identified to be part of the School Team are expected to train twice a week. Recreation Team will train once a week on Mondays.</p>
