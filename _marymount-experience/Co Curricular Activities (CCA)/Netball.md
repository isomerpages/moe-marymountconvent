<p><strong><u>Cheerleading Parents</u></strong>
<br>Parents play an important role in supporting the team! Our strong parental
support means our netballers are able to manage their tough schedule of
both academic rigor, CCA training and competing in the National School
Games.</p>

<p><strong><u>Training Hard</u></strong>
<br>The netballers’ love and dedication for the sport shows in their time
and effort spent in training not only during CCA sessions but also during
recess and holiday training during competition periods. They are always
striving for excellence!</p>

<p><strong><u>Passing On the Love of Netball</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our alumni netballers frequently take time out of their busy schedule
to help out in training to pass on their knowledge and love for the sport
to their juniors. Some of them, like Jamie Lim, play at the highest level,
representing Singapore at international tournaments!</p>

<p><strong><u>Students of the Sport</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our netballers not only take to the court to train but also study the
sport from different aspects. They learn the rules and regulations and
review matches that they have played to continually improve their performance
as a team.</p>

<p><strong>Taking the Shot</strong>
<br>Our netballers are always eager to participate in plenty of external tournaments
to broaden their range of experience. Even non-school team players have
an opportunity to compete in external netball carnivals. They always enjoy
the time spent together competing as a team!</p>
