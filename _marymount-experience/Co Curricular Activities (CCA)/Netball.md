<h4><strong>CCA Information</strong></h4>
<p>The CCA caters to pupils who are interested in Netball. Besides learning new skills and playing the game of Netball, the CCA also seeks to foster a spirit of camaraderie, responsibility and discipline among teammates. CCA members also learn important life skills like eating right and journaling their Netball learning experience for future reference.</p>
