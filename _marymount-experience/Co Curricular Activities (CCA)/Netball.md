<h4><strong>CCA Information</strong></h4>
<p>The CCA caters to students who are interested in Netball. Besides learning
new skills and playing the game of Netball, the CCA also seeks to foster
a spirit of camaraderie, responsibility and discipline among teammates.
CCA members also learn important life skills like eating right and journaling
their Netball learning experience for future reference.</p>
<p>Netballers identified to be part of the School Team are expected to train
twice a week. Recreation Team will train once a week on Mondays.</p>
