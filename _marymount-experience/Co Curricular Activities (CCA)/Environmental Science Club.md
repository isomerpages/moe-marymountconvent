<p><strong>Nurturing Passion Through Inquiry</strong> 
<br>Members carried out experiments in groups to find out how edible plants
grow in water are different from plants that grow in soil. They also build
their own simple plant hydroponics system by upcycling plastic bottles.</p>

<p><strong>Upcycling Our Way To Sustainability</strong> 
<br>Through upcycling activities, our members explore how materials can be
reused to reduce waste. During one of the sessions, they tear, soak, blend
and sieve unwanted paper in order to make them into new usable paper.</p>
