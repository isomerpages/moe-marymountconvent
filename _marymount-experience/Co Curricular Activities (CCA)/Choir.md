<p>The Choir is made up of a group of students who share the joy of singing.
Under the baton of Ms. Angila Tan, our young choristers have honed their
vocal quality, choral techniques and developed voices that resonate as
one. The Choir’s extensive repertoire ranges from classical to contemporary,
as well as local folk tunes.</p>

<p>Students in the CCA will put up performances at school events and may
be selected to perform at the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF),
the annual Singapore International Choral Festival, at school events and
other platforms such as Voices of Singapore. Students may have additional
CCA sessions to better prepare for public performances and competitions.
More information will be shared when the students are selected to perform.</p>

wide range of performances and displays in various art forms, such as music,
dance, drama, and visual arts.</p>

<p><strong>Voices of Singapore Festival</strong>
<br>With its exquisite Gothic-style design and excellent acoustics, our choristers
enjoy a beautiful choral experience performing in a non-competitive setting
at CHIJMES Hall. It is also a time of bonding as their families are invited
to attend and bask in the ethereal ambience.</p>

<p><strong>Papal Mass 2024</strong>
<br>Being a Catholic Mission school, our choristers were part of the choir
contingent at the Papal Mass when Pope Francis made a state and apostolic
visit to Singapore as part of a trip to Southeast Asia and Oceania. Being
part of the choir for this special occasion was not just about singing;
it was about being part of a historic event that will be remembered for
years to come!</p>

<p><strong>Choir School Exchange</strong>
<br>In November 2024, the choir participated in a choir exchange at Zhonghua
Primary School in which they learnt new musical approaches and vocal techniques
from other choirs. It was also a platform for our choristers to form friendships
with choristers from other schools. This was an invaluable experience which
our choristers thoroughly enjoyed!</p>
