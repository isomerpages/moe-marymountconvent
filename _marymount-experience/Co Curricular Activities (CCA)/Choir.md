<h4><strong>CCA Information</strong></h4>
<p>The Choir is made up of a group of students who share the joy of singing.
Under the baton of Ms. Angila Tan, our young choristers have honed their
vocal quality, choral techniques and developed voices that resonate as
one. The Choir’s extensive repertoire ranges from classical to contemporary,
as well as some local folk tunes.</p>

<p>Students in the CCA will put up performances at school events and may
be selected to perform at the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and
other concerts such as Voices of Singapore. Students may have additional
CCA sessions on Fridays if they must prepare for public performances and
competitions. More information will be shared when the students are selected
to perform.</p>
<p>We will continue to nurture the passion and appreciation of music in our
choristers and develop them to become individuals who are confident and
contribute actively to the community.</p>
