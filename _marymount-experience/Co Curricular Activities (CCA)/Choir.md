<h4><strong>CCA Information</strong></h4>
<p>The Choir is made up of a group of pupils who share the joy of singing. Under the baton of Ms. Angila Tan, our young choristers have honed their vocal quality, choral techniques and developed voices that resonate as one. The Choir&rsquo;s extensive repertoire ranges from classical to contemporary, as well as some local folk tunes.</p>

<p>We will continue to nurture the passion and appreciation of music in our choristers and develop them to become individuals who are confident and contribute actively to the community.</p>
