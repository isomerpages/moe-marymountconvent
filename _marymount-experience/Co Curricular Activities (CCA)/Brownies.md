<h4><strong>CCA Information</strong></h4>
<p>As Marymount Convent School’s only Uniformed Group (UG), Brownies are
encouraged to explore and discover the world around them and to become
individuals that are more confident. Brownies learn to work and play independently
and also in teams. They are constantly learning new skills and are challenged
to try new and adventurous activities that will inspire them to think about
what they want to be and do in the future.</p>

<p>Brownies are guided by a comprehensive 5-Point Programme, which develops
them in the following areas: Personal &amp; Social Development, Home, Outdoor,
Community and International. Students will go through a series of educational
and fun activities during weekly CCA meetings to learn about leading a
useful life of upholding the Brownie Motto – LEND A HAND.</p>
