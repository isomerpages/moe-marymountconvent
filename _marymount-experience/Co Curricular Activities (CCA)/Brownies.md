<p>Being a Brownie is all about learning, growing, and making a difference
in our school and community. Through games, outdoor activities, and hands-on
projects, Brownies develop important life skills like teamwork, leadership,
and creativity. Whether it’s camping under the stars, learning first aid,
baking treats, or giving back to the community, every activity is an opportunity
to discover, explore, and shine.</p>

<p>At the heart of Brownies is the Brownie Promise and Law, guiding each
girl to be kind, responsible, and always ready to lend a helping hand.
Along the way, they earn badges that recognize their achievements in areas
like science, nature, the arts, and more - turning every learning moment
into an exciting challenge!</p>

our girls to become the best version of themselves, while making unforgettable
memories with lifelong friends in Marymount Convent School.</p>
