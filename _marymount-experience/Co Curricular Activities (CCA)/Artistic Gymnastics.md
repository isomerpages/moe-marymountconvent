<h4><strong>Artistic Gymnastics: Where Strength Meets Grace</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;Artistic Gymnastics is a dynamic and challenging sport that demands
strength, flexibility, and coordination. Our CCA offers a unique opportunity
for students to develop their physical skills while cultivating valuable
life lessons.</p>

<p>Through Artistic Gymnastics, our students develop essential values, skills,
and competencies that extend beyond the gym. They learn resilience and
perseverance, overcoming fears, setbacks, and injuries to achieve their
goals. Discipline and time management become essential tools, as they balance
training, schoolwork, and personal life. Teamwork and communication are
also fostered, as gymnasts support each other, provide feedback, and work
together towards common goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As our gymnasts progress, they develop confidence and self-esteem,
cultivating a growth mindset that embraces challenges and celebrates successes.
Artistic Gymnastics also promotes physical and mental well-being, helping
students develop strength, flexibility, and coordination while managing
stress and pressure.</p>

<h4><strong>CCA Highlights</strong></h4>
<p>In Artistic Gymnastics, our gymnasts train on four apparatus: <em>Floor Exercise, Balance Beam, Vault, </em>and <em>Uneven Bars</em>.
Each apparatus presents a distinct challenge, requiring a blend of technical
skill, artistic expression, and mental toughness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Floor</strong>
</p>
<p>On the Floor Exercise, gymnasts showcase their tumbling passes, acrobatic
skills, and choreographed routines.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Balance Beam</strong>
</p>
<p>The Balance Beam tests the students' balance, poise, and focus, as they
execute precise movements on a narrow beam.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Vault</strong>
</p>
<p>Students practise running, jumping and hurdling herself onto a springboard.
Starting with beginner drills, they gradually advance to vaults that are
of higher difficulty levels. Vaulting demands speed, strength, and technique.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Uneven Bars</strong>
</p>
<p>Students acquire swings and pullover techniques, before progressing to
more advanced skills. Uneven Bars requires upper body strength, control,
and release moves.</p>
