<h4><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>Physical Education has long been equipping pupils with a strong foundation for a lifelong pursuit of a physically active and healthy lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>Currently, Physical Education is the platform that creates more opportunities for students to participate in recreational sports competitions and with the inclusion of Outdoor Education in PE where students get to understand more about the environment as they learn to navigate, assess risks and make decisions about their own safety, while enjoying the outdoors.</p>

<p>The SPOEEX framework focuses on 3 levels of involvement. The first tier of SPOEEX provides opportunities for all students to develop a positive association with physical activity through a progressive PE Programme through a variety of physical activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second tier centres on enhancing capacity through focused training and development programmes for talented and committed gymnasts, netball and tennis players.&nbsp;The students will undergo rigorous training to prepare them for the National School Games Championships.</p>
<p>The third level aims to expose our sports talents to sporting arena beyond school through competitions, collaboration and partnership with external agencies.</p>

<h4><strong>Our Department Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Sports Day</strong></p>
<p>Sports Day is an annual event for our Primary 3 to 6 students where they showcase their athletic talents on the track. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was Sports Day in a different format where sporting challenges were held in school.</p>

<p><strong>Outdoor Adventure Camp</strong></p>
<p>Participating in a variety of outdoor activities is part of the MCS experience. Through outdoor adventure camps, students learn about themselves, build friendship amongst their team and actively help each other to achieve team goals in an inclusive manner. In addition, they get to understand the importance of caring for the environment.</p>

<p>Students participate in outdoor experiences that help build their confidence and resilience, forge camaraderie with others through common experiences and cultivate responsible citizenry and affinity for Singapore.
