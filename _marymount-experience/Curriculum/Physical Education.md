<h4><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>Physical Education has long been equipping pupils with a strong foundation
for a lifelong pursuit of a physically active and healthy lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>Currently, Physical Education is the platform that creates more opportunities
for students to participate in recreational sports competitions and with
the inclusion of Outdoor Education in PE where students get to understand
more about the environment as they learn to navigate, assess risks and
make decisions about their own safety, while enjoying the outdoors.</p>

<p>The SPOEEX framework focuses on 3 levels of involvement. The first tier
of SPOEEX provides opportunities for all students to develop a positive
association with physical activity through a progressive PE Programme through
a variety of physical activities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second tier centres on enhancing capacity through focused training
and development programmes for talented and committed gymnasts, netball
and tennis players.&nbsp;The students will undergo rigorous training to
prepare them for the National School Games Championships.</p>
<p>The third level aims to expose our sports talents to sporting arena beyond
school through competitions, collaboration and partnership with external
agencies.</p>

<p><strong>Outdoor Adventure Camp</strong>
