<h4><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is integral to the holistic development of our students, leading to positive life outcomes. CCE 2021 provides an integrated approach to addressing our students&rsquo; development of values, character, socialemotional wellbeing and citizenship dispositions in a coherent and holistic way.</p>
<p>The CCE 2021 Curriculum frame takes reference from the existing Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes, and aims to enhance clarity on how the core values are linked to the social emotional competencies, and how they are internalised and lived out by our students.</p>

<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>Values Education Programme (VEP)</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Customised values-in-education lessons are conducted weekly for all pupils. Through the use of inspirational videos, newspaper articles and stories, the lessons encourage pupils to display positive behaviour by expressing the schools values - gratitude, zeal and compassion. Resources are carefully designed and chosen by teachers to provide depth and relevance to the daily experiences of the pupils.&nbsp;</td>

<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">VIA @ Marymount is a six-year program that aims to empower our pupils to contribute actively to the community. We empower our pupils through planned level programs that require pupils to take ownership of a project or concern. Through this experience, our girls will try to bring about a positive change or difference by putting into practice the school values which have been instilled during the weekly VEP lessons.</td>
