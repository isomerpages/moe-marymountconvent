<h4><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>Bilingual education in English (EL) and Mother Tongue Languages (MTLs) remain a cornerstone of Singapore&rsquo;s education system. In the face of a changing language environment with EL as the dominant language, our MTL curriculum aims to develop pupils into proficient language users who can communicate in a confident, effective and meaningful way in real-life situations, promoting MTLs as a living language among our pupils. This is also in line with our school&rsquo;s vision of nurturing our girls to be eloquent speakers. We also seek to engage our pupils in an active and interactive manner in the teaching and learning process, allowing our learners to experience joy of learning while catering to their diverse learning needs.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>Using Differentiated Instruction (DI) strategies to cater to pupils with different learner profiles.</li>
<li>Strengthen pupils&rsquo; interaction skills required of them in real life situations, in addition to acquisition of four basic skills of listening, reading, speaking and writing.</li>
<li>Tap on ICT resources for greater efficacy in teaching and learning processes.</li>
<li>Use of Formative Assessment (FA) tools to supplement graded assessments, determining the learning outcomes of pupils.</li>
<li>Instill joy of learning by creating fun and meaningful learning environments for the pupils.</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Our Department Programmes</strong></h4>
