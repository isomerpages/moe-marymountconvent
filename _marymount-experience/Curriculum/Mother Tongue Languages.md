<h4><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>Bilingual education in English (EL) and Mother Tongue Languages (MTLs)
remain a cornerstone of Singapore’s education system. In the face of a
changing language environment with EL as the dominant language, our MTL
curriculum aims to develop pupils into proficient language users who can
communicate in a confident, effective and meaningful way in real-life situations,
promoting MTLs as a living language among our pupils. This is also in line
with our school’s vision of nurturing our girls to be eloquent speakers.
We also seek to engage our pupils in an active and interactive manner in
the teaching and learning process, allowing our learners to experience
joy of learning while catering to their diverse learning needs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Festive Celebrations<br></u>In the Marymount Family, we learn to respect
different races and cultures. Festivals are the best platforms to learn
to appreciate others’ cultures and traditions. When friends from other
races celebrate the festivals close to their hearts, we share the joy with
them too!</p>
