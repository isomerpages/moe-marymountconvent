<h4><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>The department strives to enable pupils to acquire the necessary mathematical concepts and skills for everyday life and for continuous learning in mathematics and related disciplines, in a fun, encouraging and positive environment. As the pupils develop positive attitudes towards mathematics, they will be able to make effective use of a variety of mathematical tools in the learning and application of mathematics cooperatively and independently. Thus, producing imaginative and creative work arising from mathematical ideas while developing the abilities to reason logically and communicate mathematically.</p>
<p><strong>Vision:<br /></strong>Every MCS Girl a critical thinker and passionate mathematics learner.</p>
<p><strong>Mission:<br /></strong>At Marymount Convent School, our mathematics curriculum strives to enable every MCS girl to:</p>
<ul>
<li>be a good problem solver and critical thinker;</li>
<li>appreciate mathematics and relate it to everyday context;</li>
<li>develop positive attitude towards mathematics;</li>
<li>explain thoughts using appropriate mathematical language; and</li>
<li>work well with others.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) Approach</strong></p>
<p>Activity-based learning is effective for teaching mathematical concepts and skills. Pupils engage in such activities individually, in pairs or groups. They use manipulatives or other resources to construct meanings and understandings. From concrete manipulatives and experiences to pictorial representations, pupils are guided to uncover abstract mathematical concepts or results.</p>
<p><strong>P&oacute;lya&rsquo;s Four-step Problem-solving Strategy</strong></p>
<p>In teaching problem solving, teachers demonstrate how to use the strategy and models thinking aloud to make visible the thinking process.</p>
<p>The 4-step Approach:<br />1) Read and understand the problem.<br />2) Devise a plan.<br />3) Act out the plan.<br />4) Check and reflect.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning &amp; Communication @ MCS</strong></p>
<p>Mathematical processes refer to the process skills involved in the process of acquiring and applying mathematical knowledge. This includes reasoning and communication which pupils can develop through problem solving. In MCS, the pupils work in pairs or groups to lay out their working logically; communicate their thoughts clearly in both written and verbal forms; and reason inductively by observing patterns, similarities and differences. They make connections between mathematical ideas and everyday life. In MCS, we believe that reasoning, communication and problem solving skills are essential to lifelong learning.</p>
