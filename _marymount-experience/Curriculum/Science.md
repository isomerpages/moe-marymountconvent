<h4><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>The Science Department seeks to nurture students as ethical inquirers who are eager to explore the world around them. The science curriculum leverages on and seeks to fuel this spirit of curiosity providing the students with learning opportunities in valuing science as an important tool in helping them explore their natural and physical world.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>The Department inculcates in our learners the spirit of scientific inquiry. Pupils embark on experiential learning, which heightens their curiosity about the world around them, and become equipped with relevant process skills and attitudes.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Department Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><u>Inquiry Based Lessons</u></p>
<p>Pupils are constantly exposed to inquiry based experiential learning experiences during curriculum time to discover and co-construct scientific knowledge and concepts collaboratively. All these opportunities allow our pupils to experience the life of a young scientist!</p>

<p><u>School-wide Horticultural Programme</u></p>
<p>The Horticultural Programme is designed to allow pupils to &lsquo;play&rsquo; with materials that encourages them to appreciate how plants grow. Through &ldquo;playing&rdquo;, pupils not only discover the factors affecting the growth of their plants but also learn how different parts of the plant may be used to reproduce new plants.</p>
<p>Pupils imbue the values of responsibility and care for the environment as they look after and nurture their plants.</p>
