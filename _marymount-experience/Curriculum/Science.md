<h4><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>The Science Department seeks to nurture students as ethical inquirers
who are eager to explore the world around them. The science curriculum
leverages on and seeks to fuel this spirit of curiosity providing the students
with learning opportunities in valuing science as an important tool in
helping them explore their natural and physical world.</p>

<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>The Department inculcates in our learners the spirit of scientific inquiry.
Pupils embark on experiential learning, which heightens their curiosity
about the world around them, and become equipped with relevant process
skills and attitudes.</p>

<h4><strong>Our Department Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><u>Inquiry Based Lessons</u>
</p>
<p>Pupils are constantly exposed to inquiry based experiential learning experiences
during curriculum time to discover and co-construct scientific knowledge
and concepts collaboratively. All these opportunities allow our pupils
to experience the life of a young scientist!</p>

<p><u>School-wide Horticultural Programme</u>
</p>
<p>The Horticultural Programme is designed to allow pupils to ‘play’ with
materials that encourages them to appreciate how plants grow. Through “playing”,
pupils not only discover the factors affecting the growth of their plants
but also learn how different parts of the plant may be used to reproduce
new plants.</p>
<p>Pupils imbue the values of responsibility and care for the environment
as they look after and nurture their plants.</p>
<p>P1 and P2: Observing the growth of a plant.</p>
<p>P3: ‘Every Child a Seed Programme’ and ‘Mushroom Bloom!’</p>
<p>P4: Exploring Stem Cuttings</p>
<p>P5: Hydroponics</p>
<p>P6: Building a Terrarium</p>
