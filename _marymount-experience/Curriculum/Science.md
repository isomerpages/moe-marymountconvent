<h4><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>The Science Department seeks to nurture students as ethical inquirers who are eager to explore the world around them. The science curriculum leverages on and seeks to fuel this spirit of curiosity providing the students with learning opportunities in valuing science as an important tool in helping them explore their natural and physical world.</p>

<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>The Department inculcates in our learners the spirit of scientific inquiry. Pupils embark on experiential learning, which heightens their curiosity about the world around them, and become equipped with relevant process skills and attitudes.</p>

<h4><strong>Our Department Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><u>Inquiry Based Lessons</u></p>
<p>Pupils are constantly exposed to inquiry based experiential learning experiences during curriculum time to discover and co-construct scientific knowledge and concepts collaboratively. All these opportunities allow our pupils to experience the life of a young scientist!</p>

<p><u>School-wide Horticultural Programme</u></p>
<p>The Horticultural Programme is designed to allow pupils to &lsquo;play&rsquo; with materials that encourages them to appreciate how plants grow. Through &ldquo;playing&rdquo;, pupils not only discover the factors affecting the growth of their plants but also learn how different parts of the plant may be used to reproduce new plants.</p>
<p>Pupils imbue the values of responsibility and care for the environment as they look after and nurture their plants.</p>
<p>P1 and P2: Observing the growth of a plant.</p>
<p>P3: &lsquo;Every Child a Seed Programme&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mushroom Bloom!&rsquo;</p>
<p>P4: Exploring Stem Cuttings</p>
<p>P5: Hydroponics</p>
<p>P6: Building a Terrarium</p>

<h4><strong>Our Science Talent Development Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Believe that every pupil is endowed with talent in specific domains and can be developed into her fullest potential;</li>
<li>Strive to enable each pupil to discover and develop her core academics talents;</li>
<li>Believe in empowering every pupil to enhance their strengths and pursue their passions for lifelong learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Science Talent Development Programme aims to provide opportunities for P3 &ndash; P6 pupils who have the passion and desire in Science to:</p>
<ul>
<li>explore and deepen their interest in Science;</li>
<li>be critical and inventive thinkers;</li>
<li>interact and collaborate with other Science talents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our Approach</strong></p>
<p>The programme seeks to develop pupils who</p>
<ul>
<li>demonstrates a keen interest in science (e.g. by active participation during class discussions / science related activities during recess or curriculum.)</li>
<li>obtained excellent results in school-based science assessments; and</li>
<li>has a good record in Conduct.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of their development, pupils in our Science Talent Development Programme can look forward to participation in the following:</p>

<p><u>P4 &amp; P5 Science E2K</u></p>
<p>A customised 2 years training programme which provides opportunities to:</p>
<ul>
<li>develop scientific inquiry process skills among high-ability primary pupils in Science;</li>
<li>nurture other important 21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills in our pupils.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>P5 Science Olympiad Training</u></p>
<p>The Science Olympiad Programme follows closely the MOE Primary Science syllabus and a typical primary Science Olympiad syllabus. Central to the programme structure is the inculcation of the spirit of scientific inquiry through inquiry-based instruction.</p>
<p>The duration of each lesson is typically 2 hours, filled with hands-on inquiry-based experiments, followed by typical Science Olympiad MCQ questions. The whole programme also aimed to develop the various scientific process skills which are essential in any science curriculum.</p>

<p><u>P5 South Zone Cluster Run Workshops</u></p>
<p>A series of various workshops to raise pupils&rsquo; awareness and interest in the learning of Sciences. The series of workshops will focus on both Life and Physical Sciences activities and experiments and is open to High-Progress pupils from Primary 5 classes in the S3 cluster primary schools.</p>
<p>Participating pupils can look forward to completing various scientific tasks, experiments and hands-on challenges. Through their participation, it is hoped that students will appreciate the academic and humanistic aspects of Sciences and enjoy the process of exploring and enquiring science through fun and engaging experiences.</p>
