<h4><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>The Science Department seeks to nurture students as ethical inquirers
who are eager to explore the world around them. The science curriculum
leverages on and seeks to fuel this spirit of curiosity providing the students
with learning opportunities in valuing science as an important tool in
helping them explore their natural and physical world.</p>

<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>The Department inculcates in our learners the spirit of scientific inquiry.
Pupils embark on experiential learning, which heightens their curiosity
about the world around them, and become equipped with relevant process
skills and attitudes.</p>

<h4><strong>Our Department Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><u>Inquiry Based Lessons</u>
</p>
<p>Pupils are constantly exposed to inquiry based experiential learning experiences
during curriculum time to discover and co-construct scientific knowledge
and concepts collaboratively. All these opportunities allow our pupils
to experience the life of a young scientist!</p>

<p><u>School-wide Horticultural Programme</u>
</p>
<p>The Horticultural Programme is designed to allow pupils to ‘play’ with
materials that encourages them to appreciate how plants grow. Through “playing”,
pupils not only discover the factors affecting the growth of their plants
but also learn how different parts of the plant may be used to reproduce
new plants.</p>
<p>Pupils imbue the values of responsibility and care for the environment
as they look after and nurture their plants.</p>
<p>P1 and P2: Observing the growth of a plant.</p>
<p>P3: ‘Every Child a Seed Programme’ and ‘Mushroom Bloom!’</p>
<p>P4: Exploring Stem Cuttings</p>
<p>P5: Hydroponics</p>
<p>P6: Building a Terrarium</p>

<h4><strong>Our Science Talent Development Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Our Philosophy</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Believe that every pupil is endowed with talent in specific domains and
can be developed into her fullest potential;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strive to enable each pupil to discover and develop her core academics
talents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Believe in empowering every pupil to enhance their strengths and pursue
their passions for lifelong learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Science Talent Development Programme aims to provide opportunities
for P3 – P6 pupils who have the passion and desire in Science to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>explore and deepen their interest in Science;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be critical and inventive thinkers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>interact and collaborate with other Science talents.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>The programme seeks to develop pupils who</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>demonstrates a keen interest in science (e.g. by active participation
during class discussions / science related activities during recess or
curriculum.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>obtained excellent results in school-based science assessments; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>has a good record in Conduct.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of their development, pupils in our Science Talent Development
Programme can look forward to participation in the following:</p>

<p><u>P5 Science Olympiad Training</u>
</p>
<p>The Science Olympiad Programme follows closely the MOE Primary Science
syllabus and a typical primary Science Olympiad syllabus. Central to the
programme structure is the inculcation of the spirit of scientific inquiry
through inquiry-based instruction.</p>
<p>The duration of each lesson is typically 2 hours, filled with hands-on
inquiry-based experiments, followed by typical Science Olympiad MCQ questions.
The whole programme also aimed to develop the various scientific process
skills which are essential in any science curriculum.</p>

<p><u>P5 South Zone Cluster Run Workshops</u>
</p>
<p>A series of various workshops to raise pupils’ awareness and interest
in the learning of Sciences. The series of workshops will focus on both
Life and Physical Sciences activities and experiments and is open to High-Progress
pupils from Primary 5 classes in the S3 cluster primary schools.</p>
<p>Participating pupils can look forward to completing various scientific
tasks, experiments and hands-on challenges. Through their participation,
it is hoped that students will appreciate the academic and humanistic aspects
of Sciences and enjoy the process of exploring and enquiring science through
fun and engaging experiences.</p>
