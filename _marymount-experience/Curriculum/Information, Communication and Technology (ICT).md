<h4><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>ICT @ MCS aims to enhance and individualize learners’ educational experience,
helping them to enjoy learning, improve their performance, and raise standards
in literacy, numeracy and other areas of study. It aims to elevate students’
creativity, developing their digital and visual literacies by providing
them with an appropriate blend of non-technological and online resources,
extending their learning beyond the boundaries of school.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Our Department Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Digital Literacy @ MCS</strong>
</p>
<p>To prepare our students for the Digital Century, we expose students to
Coding and Programming which aim to promote their computational thinking
and develop their problem-solving skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MCS partnered Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to bring programmes
such as the Code For Fun (CFF) and A.I. For Fun (AIFF) for our students.
These programmes anchor on the academic learning of related concepts using
visual-based programming language to create a coding experience for the
students.&nbsp;</p>
