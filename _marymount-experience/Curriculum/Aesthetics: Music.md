<h4><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>The MCS music education aims to enable every student to have creative expression, allowing them to communicate through music and able to appreciate local and global music. The music curriculum also provides the basis to develop an informed and life-long involvement in music for our students.</p>

<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Music Curriculum</strong></p>
<p>Our music teachers strive to provide a student-centric curriculum through the Experience-Concept-Apply approach in our lesson modules. A range of musical instruments are also covered extensively in our curriculum as follows:</p>

<p><strong>MCS’ Got Talent</strong></p>
<p><a name="_heading=h.gjdgxs"></a>Similar to the concept of America’s Got Talent, MCS’ Got Talent is our in-house competition for students to showcase their talents in singing, dance or playing a musical instrument. Interested students go through the audition process with a solo or ensemble performance. Students who are successful in the audition, will get to showcase their performance during Teachers’ Day celebration and/or other events.</p>
