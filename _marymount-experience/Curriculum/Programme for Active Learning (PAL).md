<h4><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is a major initiative under the Primary Education Review and Implementation (PERI) Committee to place greater emphasis on the development of soft skills and social-emotional competencies in Primary 1 and 2 pupils. PAL is experiential in nature to facilitate the holistic development of pupils in the five domains of moral, cognitive, physical, social and aesthetics.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<div>
<p><strong><u>PAL @MCS<br /></u></strong>The pupils will undergo six PAL modules that include Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts (Drama) and Visual Arts.<br />These PAL modules are developed with the following objectives:</p>

* To facilitate holistic development of pupils in the five domains of moral, cognitive, physical, social and aesthetics.
* To provide varied avenues for pupils to develop social and emotional competencies.

<h4><strong>Our Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>PAL Outdoor Education<br /></strong>The pupils are required to measure the girth of a single tree. This task requires the pupils to be socially aware and to apply relationship management skills e.g. turn taking. Debrief sessions will involve pupils sharing their emotions to enhance pupils&rsquo; understanding of how their words and actions affect others.</p>

<p><strong>PAL Drama<br /></strong>Using Freeze Frame, the pupils are required to form a physical image using their own bodies to create dynamic impact. The pupils may get excited and thus, the application of self-awareness and self-management is required. Debrief sessions provide for opportunities where pupils share their thoughts and opinions about their decision-making process and impacts.</p>

<p><strong>PAL Sports and Games<br /></strong>As a group, the pupils are given a choice to choose an equipment, decide on rules and play the game. This intention creates opportunities for pupils to deliberate upon and decide on their choice of words and actions, which has a direct impact on relationship management. Debrief sessions will involve pupils sharing strategies on how to manage their emotions under various situations e.g. their excitement to contribute and/or their frustration when their suggestions were not taken up.</p>

<p><strong>PAL Visual Arts<br /></strong>As a group, the pupils are given a task and the autonomy to choose the materials they require. As the pupils deliberate upon their decisions, they effectively apply self and social awareness competencies. Debrief sessions will involve pupils sharing their emotions to enhance pupils&rsquo; understanding of how their words and actions affect others.</p>
