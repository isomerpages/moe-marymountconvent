<h4><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>The MCS art education aims to enable every student to be visually literate
and to appreciate art. When our students are visually literate, they are
able to observe, understand and make meaning of what they see. They will
also be able to communicate their ideas through art and recognize the relevance
of art in their lives.</p>

<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>Our art teachers strive to provide a student-centric curriculum through
Inquiry-Based Learning and the use of thinking routines. Through our art
curriculum, we also aim to expose students to an extensive variety of art
forms and mediums. During the art making process, our students document
their journey in their MCS Visual Journals. Through a progressive approach
in the writing of their artist statements that accompanies every artwork
created, students also learn to be critical thinkers by having a voice
in their artworks.</p>

<p>On top of the curriculum art lessons, MCS also provides opportunities
for our students to experience various art forms through our signature
art programmes as below.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Department Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Art Legacy</strong>
</p>
<p>It is an MCS tradition where the P6 cohort will leave behind an Art Legacy
piece. As part of the post-PSLE WELL programme and as a form of contribution
back to MCS, students would create an artwork as a level and have it installed
in spaces around the school.</p>

<p><strong>MCS Budding Artist Exhibition</strong>
</p>
<p>Our annual MCS Budding Artist Exhibition provides opportunities for student
artists to showcase their work. It is also a good platform to expose students
to art appreciation using thinking routines.</p>
<p>The exhibition is segmented into two showcases – featuring selected curriculum
artworks from the P1 to P6 and selected artworks from Art Club.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>MCS Recess Performance</strong>
</p>
<p>Our students brought vibrant energy and talent to the school during the
Recess Performance Showcase, where they performed for their peers in a
lively and supportive atmosphere. From melodic renditions on musical instruments
to heartfelt vocal performances, each act reflected the students’ dedication
and passion for the performing arts. The initiative provided a platform
for students to share their gifts beyond the classroom, and it was heartening
to see how warmly their peers received them—cheering, clapping, and showing
enthusiastic support throughout. The performances not only brightened up
the recess break but also fostered a strong sense of camaraderie and school
spirit among the student body.</p>
