<h4><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>At MCS, we believe that every child can grow to be competent and confident
users of the English language. We deliver an enriched curriculum that teaches
our students to appreciate the nuances of the English language, develop
critical thinking skills and equip them with the necessary competencies
that are essential for communicating in the real world.</p>

<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>We use Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading (STELLAR)
as our primary approach to deliver the national curriculum. Lessons are
further enriched by our school-based programmes that integrate listening,
speaking, reading, viewing and writing into the language learning process.</p>

<p><strong>1. Reading @ MCS<br></strong>Reading is the cornerstone of acquiring
language skills. Students are encouraged to engage in book exploration
during their reading and library periods. Our school library hosts games
and activities that excite our students to read and share their love for
books with their peers. We organise book talks by authors, who share the
process behind writing good stories.</p>
<p>At the Upper Primary levels, the study of current affairs is integrated
into the curriculum where students read about world news. They reflect
on these and express their thoughts through journal writing.</p>
<p><strong>2. Writing @ MCS<br></strong>Writing is an important form of communication.
At MCS, we focus on teaching writing as an iterative process. Students
are guided through the different stages of writing (ideation, drafting,
receiving feedback, editing, publishing) as we believe that the rigour
of the process is as important as the final product.</p>
<p><strong>3. Oracy @ MCS<br></strong>Communicating effectively is a key
competency of the 21<sup>st</sup>Century. The Whole School Approach to
Effective Communication (WSA-EC) seeks to achieve this desired outcome
for every student through customised programmes. Some platforms for students
to give oral presentations include ‘Characters come Alive!’, Readers’ Theatre
and our Speak Well presentations.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Department Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong><u>Speak Well Programme</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Speak Well Programme aims to develop a sense of confidence and eloquence
in our students through the explicit sharing of values.</p>
<p>It requires our students to first write about a given theme that is tied
to our school values. During the process, they do research and reflect
on their own experiences to form convincing beliefs about the given theme.</p>
<p>Students present their thoughts and share their experiences with their
peers in class, and representatives from each class would do similarly
during assembly, to a wider audience. With the shift to e-assembly, our
students design a deck of slides to accompany their speeches, making their
presentations even more engaging to the audience.</p>

<p><strong><u>MCS Reading Programme</u></strong>
</p>
<p>This programme aims to introduce students to different genres and inculcate
in them a love for reading. Through a series of lessons, students will
read for enjoyment and explore the common features and thematic elements
of various genres. The lessons are designed not only to engage, delight
and entertain pupils, but also to teach and reinforce values.</p>
<p><strong><u>Termly English Book Sharing</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In each term, we introduce new genres and recommend good reads to our
students. The focus of each term is as follows.</p>
<p>Term 1: Graphic Novels Genre</p>
<p>Term 2: Books on the Environment</p>
<p>Term 3: Books by Local Authors</p>
<p>Term 4: Realistic Fiction Genre</p>
<p>The books that we recommend can be found in our school library so that
students have access to them. More information on MCS’ library programmes
may be found at the following link:&nbsp;<a href="/marymount-experience/mcs-library" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://marymountconvent.moe.edu.sg/marymount-experience/mcs-library</a>
