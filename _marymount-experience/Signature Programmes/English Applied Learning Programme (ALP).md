<p>The English Applied Learning Programme (ALP) connects classroom learning
with real-life applications and therefore allows students to better appreciate
the connection with post-secondary education and industries.</p>

<p>The school endeavours to develop students to express themselves with clarity,
confidence and a strong sense of purpose to serve. To this end, we will
provide opportunities for advocacy beyond the school environment through
Values-in-Action projects and partnering with the Good Shepherd Order,
which we believe will allow the girls to apply the skill, in the real-world
context, for the greater good of the community.</p>

<p>At Marymount Convent School (MCS), the Talent Development Framework provides
for an enriched curriculum, through which the school seeks to develop the
Marymount Girl in her areas of passion and strength in various disciplines.
The ALP will focus on the language discipline, developing and honing effective
communicators, thereby supporting our school vision (Ladies of Compassion,
Eloquence and Intellect, with God as our Shepherd) and mission (Empowering
Lives, Restoring Rights, and Upholding Dignity).</p>
<p>With these in mind, the English Applied Learning Programme @ MCS aims
to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop Marymount Girls who communicate with clarity and confidence</p>
</li>
<li>

<p><strong>English Language Learning Journeys </strong>- these learning journeys
