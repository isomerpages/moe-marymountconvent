<h4><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Our Vision:&nbsp;</strong>Every pupil a&nbsp;<strong>STAR</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>S</strong>hining&nbsp;<strong>T</strong>hrough the&nbsp;<strong>AR</strong>ts)</p>
<p><strong>Our Mission:&nbsp;</strong>To develop&nbsp;<strong><u>C</u></strong>onfident and&nbsp;<strong><u>C</u></strong>ompassionate&nbsp;<strong><u>C</u></strong>ommunicators of the Arts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Grooming Cultured and Refined Ladies through the Aesthetics</strong></p>
<p>The school&rsquo;s vision of developing students who are refined and cultured, as well as her mission of developing students&rsquo; full potential holistically through the Aesthetics, is achieved through the implementation of the STAR Framework as below &ndash; a distinctive Arts Excellence programme that permeates the whole school community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides honing students&rsquo; artistic skills through involvement and active participation in the various art forms, another key aim of STAR is to nurture good character in the student. Through STAR, the school values instilled will serve as the students&rsquo; moral compass while the acquisition of life skills will better prepare them for the future by developing their 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century competencies, ultimately developing the students as confident and compassionate communicators of the Arts.</p>
