<h4><strong>Growth Mindset @ MCS</strong></h4>
<p>Growth Mindset is a belief system that suggests abilities and intelligence
can be developed through efforts, strategies and resilience. Coined by
psychologist Carol Dweck, this concept contrasts with a fixed mindset,
which assumes talents are innate and unchangeable. Her research into children's
self-theories shows that people with growth mindsets consistently try to
stretch themselves beyond their comfort zone to learn new things. They
are willing to work hard and are resilient in the face of setbacks – the
very qualities that predict the flourishing of ability over time. On the
other hand, people with fixed mindsets believe their intelligence or talent
alone creates success – without effort. A fixed mindset turns pupils away
from learning, even when that learning is crucial to their future success.</p>
