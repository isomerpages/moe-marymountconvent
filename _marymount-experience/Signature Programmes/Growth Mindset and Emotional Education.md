<h4>Growth Mindset @ Marymount Convent School</h4>
<p>Growth Mindset is a belief system that suggests abilities and intelligence
can be developed through efforts, strategies and resilience. Coined by
psychologist Carol Dweck, this concept contrasts with a fixed mindset,
which assumes talents are innate and unchangeable. Her research into children's
self-theories shows that people with growth mindsets consistently try to
stretch themselves beyond their comfort zone to learn new things. They
are willing to work hard and are resilient in the face of setbacks – the
very qualities that predict the flourishing of ability over time. On the
other hand, people with fixed mindsets believe their intelligence or talent
alone creates success – without effort. A fixed mindset turns pupils away
from learning, even when that learning is crucial to their future success.</p>
<p>At MCS, we unpack the strategies required to cultivate a Growth Mindset
through:</p>
<p>1. Effective Effort including reflective practices (use of feedback)</p>
<p>2. Key E21CC skills, with a focus on adaptive thinking, collaboration
and communication.</p>
<p>3. Strong emotional management and regulation with the acquisition of
SEL (Social and Emotional Learning) competencies</p>
<p>Our approach equips students with effective effort and strategies aligned
to the development of a Growth Mindset. This is illustrated in the diagrams
below, which demonstrates how these elements work together to foster Growth
Mindset in our learners.</p>
