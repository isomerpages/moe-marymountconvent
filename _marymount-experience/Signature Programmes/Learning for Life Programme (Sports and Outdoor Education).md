<h4><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h4><p><strong>Enhancing Holistic Health through Sports and Outdoor Education (LLP)<br></strong>Aimed at developing students who are healthy in body, mind and soul, the Sports and Outdoor Education modules of the school seek to prepare our students holistically to meet the challenges of the 21st century.&nbsp;The school’s Outdoor Education Programme (OEP) spans the three domains indicated below and is a platform to facilitate values education and imbibe social emotional learning.</p><h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4><p>The Sports Excellence (SPOEEX) @Marymount programme framework focusses on 3 levels of involvement, the first being enabling students to have a positive association through a progressive PE programme. The school’s PE lessons are distinctive due to a number of reasons. Social emotional competencies are foregrounded in certain PE lessons and these competencies are assessed and included in the PE Holistic Assessment reports that are issued once a semester to reflect students’ development. The second level focuses on enhancing the capacity of talented gymnasts, netball and tennis players through focused training and developmental programmes offered as competitive CCAs. At the third level, students are given exposure to the sporting arena beyond school – at the national and international levels.</p><p>The school’s Outdoor Education Programme (OEP) spans the three domains indicated below and is a platform to facilitate values education and imbibe social emotional learning.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 75%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/llp1.png"></div><p>The school has put in place a co-curricular programme, in which the OEP is embedded, the Week of Experiential Learning (a week dedicated to students’ experiential learning outdoors which includes camps and outdoor learning journeys).</p><p>The different Sports and Outdoor Education modules run as threads through the various programme components, serving as opportunities and platforms for students to develop the 21st century competencies and strive towards and actualise the student outcomes of :</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>A Confident Person</p></li><li><p>A Self-Directed Learner</p></li><li><p>An Active Contributor</p></li><li><p>A Concerned Citizen</p></li></ul><p>These include :</p><p>1.

During the WELL, students are also given opportunities to participate in outdoor learning activities such as trekking and water-based activities. These experiences are planned to heighten students’ environmental awareness and enhance students’ basic survival skills. The outdoor learning activities for the various levels are as such:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Primary 1 – Bishan Park</p></li><li><p>Primary 2 – Singapore Botanic Gardens</p></li><li><p>Primary 3 – Trekking at Labrador Park</p></li><li><p>Primary 4 – Trekking at Coney Island</p></li><li><p>Primary 5 – Trekking at Dairy Farm</p></li><li><p>Primary 6 – Trekking at Southern Ridges</p></li></ul><p>Collectively, pulling together the different threads of the various Sports and Outdoor Education modules in both the curriculum and co-curriculum, the school seeks to offer a comprehensive and integrated programme that is undergirded by the school values and designed to enhance students’ holistic health. The school aims to raise our daughters of Marymount by developing them cognitively, physically, socially and morally, to be ready for the 21st century.</p><h4><strong>Our Programmes</strong></h4><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Map Reading</strong></p><p>By Primary 6, students will be able to use local maps to navigate their way from the city to Sentosa using public transport.</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/llp2.jpg"></div></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Zip-line experience</strong></p><p>This is the highlight of the Primary 6 Camp where students get to overcome their fear of height and experience high elements at Sentosa.</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/llp3.jpg"></div></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Obstacles Course</strong></p><p>At Primary 3, students are exposed to low elements during Day Camp.
