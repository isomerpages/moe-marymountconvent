<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>In these attachments, you will find some suggested book titles for you and your child to enjoy. The books have been categorised into lower, middle and upper primary for our girls.</p>
<p><em>Please click on the picture, and it will lead you to the full list of books.</em></p>
<p>Please note that these suggestions represent only a small sampling of the many fun, interesting and thought-provoking books to be discovered by your child. These books are available at the school library so do encourage your daughter to borrow them. Due to Covid-19, our girls are only allowed to borrow books directly from the library during their weekly library period.</p>
<p>We hope that the girls have a lovely time exploring the books!</p>
<p><strong>Happy Reading!</strong></p>
