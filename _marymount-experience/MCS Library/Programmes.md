<p><strong>3. Early Bird Book Sharing:</strong>&nbsp;Stuck wondering what
to read? Eager to explore new genres? Look out for our sharing during the
early bird slot (before morning assembly). Every term, we introduce new
genres and recommend good reads for English and Mother Tongue languages.
You may discover your next favourite book!</p>
<p><strong>4. Adopt-a-book Corner:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p>We may grow out of a book, but a book can never be wasted. To encourage
a culture of paying it forward and recycling responsibly, we ask that you
donate your pre-loved books (in good condition!) to the Adopt-a-book corner
in the canteen.</p>
<p>If you find a book there that you would like to read, you may help yourselves
and adopt the book home!</p>
<p><strong>5. Class Library</strong>: Each class has a curated selection
of books for pupils to browse and borrow. These mini libraries are manned
by our class librarians and loved by all!</p>

student leaders in their own right. They help out in the school library
with tasks such as shelving, maintaining order and recommending books.</p>
