<p><strong>3. </strong><strong>Early Bird Book Sharing:</strong>&nbsp;Stuck wondering what to read? Eager to explore new genres? Look out for our sharing during the early bird slot (before morning assembly). Every term, we introduce new genres and recommend good reads for English and Mother Tongue languages. You may discover your next favourite book!</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong><strong>Adopt-a-book Corner:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<img style="width: 45%;" src="/images/prog7.jpeg" align = "right" />
<p>We may grow out of a book, but a book can never be wasted. To encourage a culture of paying it forward and recycling responsibly, we ask that you donate your pre-loved books (in good condition!) to the Adopt-a-book corner in the canteen.</p>
<p>If you find a book there that you would like to read, you may help yourselves and adopt the book home!</p>
<p><strong>5. </strong><strong>Class Library</strong>: Each class has a curated selection of books for pupils to browse and borrow. These mini libraries are manned by our class librarians and loved by all!</p>

<p><strong>6. </strong><strong>School Librarians:</strong>&nbsp;These P4-P6 avid readers are student leaders in their own right. They help out in the school library with tasks such as shelving, maintaining order and recommending books.</p>
