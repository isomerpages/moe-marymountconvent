<h4><strong>Igniting and Shining with Marymount’s Light Ceremony</strong></h4>
<p><em>God is our Light</em>: Marymount Convent School’s (MCS) ideals are
encapsulated both in this little motto and our very unique tradition called
the Light Ceremony which was held at the beginning of the school year.</p>

<p>Our former MCS school supervisor, Sister Delphine Kang, RGS, who inaugurated
the ceremony 15 years ago, said: “When I returned to work in school after
some years in social service, the motto was on the school walls, its crest,
and on students’ badges. Yet few actually paid attention to it.”</p>
<p></p>

<p>Thus she envisioned a ceremony that focused on God, who is Light to all,
and how school staff and students can pass this Light of God to all they
encounter.</p>

<h4><strong>Igniting the light</strong></h4>

<p>One day before the ceremony, each girl received a candle cut-out, symbolising
the light God has given them e.g. their talents, gifts, knowledge, wisdom
and grace. On it, they were asked to write down a talent or gift they would
like to share with others. This made them conscious of the ‘Light’ they
possessed and were called to pass on.</p>

<p>The next day at the Ceremony, as the hymn "Pass It On" was played, the
girls came forward to paste the candles onto a big ‘class candle,’ in a
touching and beautiful gesture of committing themselves to the school motto,
‘God is Our Light’.</p>
<p>“Visually pasting their individual candles onto the big class candle is
a powerful way for the girls to see how they too are able to give something
of themselves, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant it may be
to others,” said Mrs Evelyn Chia, a Primary 3 teacher who has two daughters
in the school.</p>
<p>Another teacher, Ms Amanda Yeo, shared similar sentiments. “The pasting
of the candles allows the girls to feel part of the community even though
they took part in the Ceremony via Zoom” especially as each class candle
was then proudly put up on the class notice board.</p>
<h4><strong>Shining the light</strong></h4>
<p>The highlight of the Ceremony is the passing of the flame from Sr Delphine
as school supervisor to the school leaders, and then to the teachers, and
finally to the student representatives, all happening while the same hymn
Pass It On is played.</p>
<p>It is always a meaningful moment when all members of the school pledge
to commit themselves to lead and help one another to grow in knowledge,
wisdom and grace, guided by God’s unconditional love.</p>

<p>Explained Vice-Principal Mdm Anna Tan, “The Light Ceremony is a very significant
event in the life of a new student in Marymount Convent where she is welcomed
into our school family in Primary 1. For the next five years here, she
is reminded of the love she receives from God through this family, and
how she can spread this love to others. This is a beautiful tradition which
we want all our students to remember fondly.”</p>

<p>Mdm Elaine Han, who just joined the school this year as a senior teacher,
said, “Being new to the school, this was my first time taking part in the
Light Ceremony. I was touched when the hymns were being played. I felt
that it was a meaningful experience for the girls and staff as all of them,
Catholics and non-Catholics alike, especially at the start of the year.”</p>

<p>The Light Ceremony gives us an identity of our mission as a Good Shepherd
school, anchoring the school year and giving a meaningful start for the
whole school population. It is something we truly look forward to every
year. It reminds us of our personal commitment as teachers, to be the light
and to share God’s Light with others through our gifts, our strengths and
values, especially with our students and the whole school community.</p>

<h4><strong>Opening Mass</strong></h4>
<p>At Marymount Convent School, the academic year begins with the Light Ceremony
and Opening Mass, a cherished tradition that unites the school community
in faith and purpose. Held early in the school year, this Mass sets a reflective
and hopeful tone for the months ahead.</p>
<p>During the Opening Mass, students, teachers, and staff come together to
seek blessings for the new academic journey. The ceremony includes prayers,
hymns, and readings that emphasize the school's values of compassion, eloquence,
and intellect. This spiritual gathering reinforces the school's commitment
to nurturing not only academic excellence but also moral and spiritual
growth among its students.</p>
<p>The Opening Mass is more than a religious observance; it is a moment for
the entire Marymount family to reaffirm their shared mission and to inspire
one another to live out the school's ethos in their daily lives. By commencing
the year with this solemn and unifying event, Marymount Convent School
underscores the importance of faith and community in its educational approach.</p>
