<p>At Marymount Convent School, the academic year begins with the Opening
Mass, a cherished tradition that unites the school community in faith and
purpose. Held early in the school year, this Mass sets a reflective and
hopeful tone for the months ahead.</p>
<p></p>
<p>During the Opening Mass, students, teachers, and staff come together to
seek blessings for the new academic journey. The ceremony includes prayers,
hymns, and readings that emphasize the school's values of compassion, eloquence,
and intellect. This spiritual gathering reinforces the school's commitment
to nurturing not only academic excellence but also moral and spiritual
growth among its students.</p>
<p>The Opening Mass is more than a religious observance; it is a moment for
the entire Marymount family to reaffirm their shared mission and to inspire
one another to live out the school's ethos in their daily lives. By commencing
the year with this solemn and unifying event, Marymount Convent School
underscores the importance of faith and community in its educational approach.</p>
