<p>As we celebrate Foundress Day, we look to St Mary Euphrasia's strength,
determination and faith in God, to make a difference, even in the face
of adversity.</p>
<p>Rose Virginie had a great passion to lead a life of selflessness and in
the service of God. Driven by her understanding of what it meant to grief
for your loved ones and experiencing loneliness, she was driven to help
others in need as she could empathize with them. She did this with love
and determination.</p>

<p>153 years after St. Mary Euphrasia's death, the Congregation of Our Lady
of Charity of the Good Shepherd continues her work to care for women and
girls in need, from every continent.</p>

<p>"Say to my dear children that I tenderly bless them, that no one has been
forgotten. I died a daughter of the holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church."
St Mary Euphrasia</p>
