<h4><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h4><p>Our Expanded Learning Experiences (OELE) is an after school programme with a comprehensive curriculum which seeks to expose our students to a broad range of non-academic activities and experiences with a focus on developing the students in social-emotional and 21st century skills.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 60%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/oele11.jpg"></div><p>The objectives of OELE are to:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>instill life skills through interactive and experiential activities;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>promote physical and character development holistically;</p></li><li><p>nurture joy of learning.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4><p>The OELE curriculum is experiential in nature, integrates learning in a creative and fun manner, and provides ample opportunities for students to explore, create and make connections of their learning in a meaningful approach. Experiences include workshops on self-management skills and ICT skills such as coding.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 60%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/oele12.jpg"></div><p><strong>Primary 1</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>OELE Leadership</p><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><u>Level-specific Programme – Student Leadership</u></p></li></ol></li></ul><p>Very importantly, our school places strong emphasis on student leadership and encourages all students to seize the many opportunities provided for them. The school aims to provide every student a leadership opportunity, equipping them with the necessary leadership skills and competencies which will help them to confidently assume the various leadership roles offered by the school. Skills and competencies learnt will also be reinforced during curriculum time.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 60%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/oele9.jpg"></div><p><br></p><p>• To enhance students’ social-emotional competencies to lead self effectively.</p><p>• To allow students to understand the different leadership styles and discover their own style of leadership.</p><p>• To incorporate design thinking principles in solving daily authentic problems.</p><p>• To nurture students as reflective practitioners.</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Dance</p></li><li><p>Rope Skipping</p><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><u>Electives – Rope Skipping and Dance</u></p></li></ol></li></ul><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/oele6.jpg"></div><p>Besides honing their leadership skills, our school aims to provide a platform for students to explore and experience various sports and aesthetics. The rope skipping and dance lessons will not only help students to develop a keen sense of balance and rhythm but also enhance their motor skills, coordination, and dexterity. At the same time, students get to pick up a new skill while interacting with their schoolmates in the same level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Primary 2</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>ICT Coding (Lightbot)</p><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Level-specific Programme – ICT Coding</p></li></ol></li></ul><p>The ICT Coding workshop is offered to and differentiated across various levels to instil in our girls some of the fundamental problem-solving and analytical skills. At Primary 2, students will be introduced to basic coding while engaging in simple, hands-on activities involving a robot in an application on iPad. This not only provides the exposure to computational thinking, but also enhances creativity and critical thinking skills. As students work with their peers to attempt the various stages in pairs, it ultimately promotes valuable collaborative and communicative skills.</p><p>• Introduction to Basic Coding II</p><p>• Introduction to concepts of programming using icons in a coding game</p><p>• Increases students’ exposure to computational thinking</p><p>• Enhances creativity, collaboration, critical thinking and communication skills</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Dance</p></li><li><p>Art</p><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Electives – Art and Dance</p></li></ol></li></ul><p>Besides honing their computational thinking skills, our school aims to provide a platform for students to explore and experience various arts.

At the end of the session, students to get to apply their knowledge by stringing their own beads and completing their bracelet design.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Taekwondo</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Primary 4</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>ICT Coding (Micro:bit)</p><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Level-specific Programme – ICT Coding</p></li></ol></li></ul><p>The ICT Coding workshop is offered to and differentiated across various levels to instil in our students some of the fundamental problem-solving and analytical skills. At Primary 4, students will be introduced to intermediate coding while engaging in hands-on activities involving a microcontroller (Micro:bit), and some simple circuits. The exposure to block-based programming and computational thinking develops creativity and critical thinking skills. As students work with their peers to attempt the various stages in pairs, it ultimately promotes valuable collaborative and communicative skills.</p><p>• Introduction to Intermediate Coding with microcontroller (Micro:bit)</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Block-based Programming</p></li><li><p>Simple electronics and circuits</p></li></ul><p>• Increases students’ exposure to computational thinking</p><p>• Enhances creativity, collaboration, critical thinking and communication skills</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Culinary</p><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Besides honing their computational thinking skills, our school aims to provide a platform for students to explore and experience other skills such as culinary.
